##Assignment Overview

This project is a simple Employee Management Dashboard built using React.js.
The goal of this assignment was to create a frontend application where users can log in and manage employee details such as adding, editing, deleting, searching, and filtering employees.

To keep the project simple and focused on frontend concepts, mock authentication and browser localStorage are used instead of a backend API.

##Tech Stack Used

React.js (JavaScript)

React Router DOM

HTML5

CSS3

Browser localStorage (for storing employee data)

##Main Features

Login page with mock authentication

Protected dashboard route (cannot access without login)

Add, edit, and delete employee records

Upload profile image with preview before saving

Search employees by name

Filter employees by gender and active/inactive status

Dashboard summary showing total, active, and inactive employees

Print employee list

Responsive and clean user interface

##Assumptions and Design Decisions

This project uses localStorage as a mock data source instead of a backend server.

Authentication is mock-based and implemented only to protect routes.

The focus was on functionality, clarity, and clean code rather than advanced backend logic.

All features were implemented based on the assignment requirements.

##Notes

No external UI libraries were used.

This project is suitable for demo and assignment review purposes.
